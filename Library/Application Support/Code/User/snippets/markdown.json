	// Place your snippets for Markdown here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Print to console": {
		"prefix": "log",
		"body": [
			"console.log('$1');",
			"$2"

		"description": "Log output to console"
